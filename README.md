# Fetch Rewards Frontend Take Home Challenge

## Abstract
This is a take home challenge for the Frontend Engineer position at Fetch Rewards. A user can view a form with inputs for name, email, password, location, and occupation. Location and Occupation fields are autopopulated via fetched data. Upon submission of the form, a user can see if it was submitted successfully or not, or an error urging the user to complete the form.
